# Project: Landing page

A responsive landing page built as part of The Odin Project – Foundations curriculum.
The goal of this project is to recreate a full webpage layout from a provided design, focusing on layout, spacing, and basic styling rather than pixel-perfect accuracy.

This project demonstrates core front-end skills including:
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS Flexbox for layout
- Basic styling (fonts, colors, spacing, borders)
- Translating a static design into a working webpage

The original design was provided as reference images outlining the overall layout, typography, and color palette. While the final result does not aim to be an exact pixel-by-pixel match, it closely follows the intended structure and visual hierarchy of the design.

Some content and images may be customized or substituted to personalize the page, while maintaining the overall layout and design principles.

# Preview
